# TinkerCAD-Project
A simple project which gets temperature and light reading from respective sensors and actuates a DC motor and a servo motor.  If the light is too low the servo motor will go to open state (which might be useful to open a window to let the light in).  Otherwise, the servo motor will remain in a closed state. On the other hand, when the temperature is too high, the DC motor starts to work (this may be used as a fan).
